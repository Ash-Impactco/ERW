## Summary

Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising carbon removal technology. The global landscape of ERW projects is rapidly evolving, with initiatives in regions such as Madeira, Azores, and India. Data from CDR.fyi, PEESEgroup, and scientific literature provide a foundation for mapping, analysis, and scenario modeling of ERW's decarbonization potential.
