# Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) Analysis Dashboard

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) potential across different regions, evaluating decarbonization performance and economic viability under various carbon pricing scenarios.

## Features

- Interactive global map showing ERW potential regions
- Regional analysis with detailed metrics
- Economic assessment under different carbon pricing scenarios
- ROI calculations for different regions
- Time horizon projections

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
